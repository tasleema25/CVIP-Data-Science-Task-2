Project:- Email Spam Detection
Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.
This project mainly uses the Naive-Bayes method to detect if a email or message is spam or not.
The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.96 and an ROC AUC of 1.00. The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails. The high accuracy score of 0.96 indicates that the model correctly classifies the majority of the emails, with only a small percentage of misclassifications. This showcases the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm in handling text classification tasks like email spam detection.
